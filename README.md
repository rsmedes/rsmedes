## Hi 👁️‍🗨️

I help big teams ship secure code faster as a Staff CSM at GitHub. I work with enterprise customers to make the most of GitHub Copilot, GitHub Advanced Security, and GitHub Enterprise—think fewer bugs, accelerated developer velocity, more high-fives. Former Customer Reliability Engineer, and Technical Account Manager. Recovering ETL developer, part-time API whisperer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on mastering GitHub Coding Agent 🚀 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bridge AI-powered development with enterprise-scale security and reliability.
- 💬 Ask me about GitHub Copilot, GHAS, Enterprise Server weirdness, or help writing SQL queries
